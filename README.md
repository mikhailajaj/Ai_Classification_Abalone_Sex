# Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Sex Classification in Abalone

## Abstract

This study delves into the predictive analysis of abalone sex, a critical classification challenge in marine biology with direct implications for ecological research and aquaculture management. Leveraging the power of PyCaret, an advanced machine learning library in Python, the research systematically explores and evaluates a variety of algorithms to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model. Employing a dataset rich in morphological attributes of abalones, the study undertakes rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization processes. The culmination of this research is a machine learning model that demonstrates a commendable balance of predictive capabilities. It achieves a mean accuracy of 56.72% across a series of ten cross-validated folds, with a standard deviation of 1.68%, indicating consistent performance. The model further exhibits a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 75.94%, alongside balanced recall, precision, and F1 scores in the mid-50s percentage range. These metrics, complemented by Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient values, underline the model's efficacy and reliability in distinguishing between the sexes of abalones. This research not only contributes to the practical field of marine biology by providing a non-invasive, scalable solution for sex determination in abalones but also illustrates the versatility and effectiveness of machine learning in addressing complex biological classification problems.
